# CoinSpyre Blockchain

Coming Soon... This Project Is Still 
Under Development....

## CoinSpyre Core / Staging Tree
For an immediately usable, binary version of 
the CoinSpyre Core software.

## What is CoinSpyre?
CoinSpyre is a new experimental form of digital
currency. The CoinSpyre Core connects 
to the CoinSpyre 
peer-to-peer network to download and 
fully validate blocks and transactions. 
It also includes a wallet and graphical 
user interface.
 ## License
CoinSpyre Core is released under the 
terms of the MIT license. See [COPYING](https://github.com/CoinSpyre/CoinSpyre/blob/main/LICENSE) for more information or see https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT.

## Development Process
The ```master``` branch is meant to be stable. 
Development is normally done in separate 
branches. ```Tags``` are created to indicate 
new official, stable release versions 
of CoinSpyre Core.

## Testing
Testing and code review is the bottleneck 
for development; we get more pull requests
than we can review and test on short notice.
Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember 
this is a security-critical project
where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.


## Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing
Changes should be tested by somebody other 
than the developer who wrote the code. 
This is especially important for large or 
high-risk changes. It is useful to add a 
test plan to the pull request description 
if testing the changes is not straightforward.
